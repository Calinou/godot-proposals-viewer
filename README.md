# Godot proposals viewer

View the current Godot proposals in a convenient way.

## Development

Follow these instructions to set up this site locally for development purposes:

- Run `build.sh` to fetch proposals from the GitHub API. It makes about 10
  requests, which means you don't need to set up API authentication to bypass
  the 60 requests/hour limit.
- Start a local web server in the root directory then browse `index.html`.
